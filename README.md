I'm a software engineering student at Braude college, highly motivated and determined individual with a strong passion for coding. I look for opportunities that challenge me and fulfill my passion, and I seize them where I find them.

I'm currently interested in applying the basics acquired from my first year courses while delving deeper into the fundamentals.
I'm deeply interested in game development as well as developing web projects with Node.JS.
